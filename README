Glimmer - a JRuby DSL that enables easy and efficient authoring of user-interfaces 
using the robust platform-independent Eclipse SWT library. Glimmer comes with built-in 
data-binding support to greatly facilitate synchronizing UI with domain models.

Instructions for use with stand-alone SWT:
1. Download the "SWT binary and source" archive from the Eclipse site and follow their instructions.
   http://www.eclipse.org/swt/
2. Have your program require the file: src/swt.rb
3. Create a class that includes the Glimmer module and you will be able to write Glimmer syntax

Instructions for use with Eclipse:
1. Download and setup Eclipse 3.4, 3.3 or 3.2
2. Download and setup jRuby 1.1.5
3. Modify Java launch command in jRuby script/batch file to include SWT libraries in both:
 a. Classpath; must include %ECLIPSE_HOME%/plugins/org.eclipse.swt*.jar 
  For example with Eclipse 3.2 on Windows, we add the following: 
  -cp "%CLASSPATH%;%ECLIPSE_HOME%\plugins\org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.2.0.v3232m.jar;%ECLIPSE_HOME%\plugins\org.eclipse.swt_3.2.0.v3232o.jar"
 b. java.library.path; must point to %ECLIPSE_HOME%/plugins/org.eclipse.swt* folder 
  For example, with Eclipse 3.2 on Windows, we add the following:
  -Djava.library.path="%ECLIPSE_HOME%\plugins\org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.2.0.v3232m" 
4. Have your program require the file: src/swt.rb
5. Create a class that includes the Glimmer module and you will be able to write Glimmer syntax

Check samples folder for examples on how to write Glimmer applications.
