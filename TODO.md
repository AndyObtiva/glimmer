## Next

- Extract data-binding/observe keywords from glimmer-dsl-swt back into glimmer as a built in default DSL. That way, they can be shared/reused with glimmer-dsl-opal and glimmer-dsl-tk
- Extract glimmer-dsl-databinding out of glimmer as an observer/data-binding DSL library and reuse across other DSLs (SWT, Opal, and Tk)
- Move glimmer projects underneath glimmer organization

- Fix issue with 'handle' keyword cascading to last expression handler incorrectly
- Extract glimmer rake tasks that are common from glimmer-dsl-swt into glimmer such as list:gems:dsl

### Version TBD

- Add in-model support for specifying computed observer dependencies to avoid specifying it in the bind statement. 
- Consider creating a configuration DSL

## Refactorings

- Prefix ObservableModel/ObservableArray utility methods with double-underscore
- Observer: refactor code to be more smart/polymorphic/automated and honor open/closed principle
- Observer: optimize performance in the future via indexing and/or making a registration official object/class
