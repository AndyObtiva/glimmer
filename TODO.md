# TODO

Here is a list of tasks to do (please delete once done):

* Support Tree databinding (bidirectional)
* Figure out what is missing from table databinding (bidirectional?)
* Explore rewriting shine with Ruby 2 support
* Add a startup progress dialog (consider Glimmer branding)
* Externalize constants to make easily configurable
* Extract ListenerParent into its own file from WidgetListenerCommandHandler
* Nested databinding support
* Enhance XML DSL support (special characters, CDATA, escaped characters (#, {, }, .))
* Verify nested data binding works with tables/trees/combos
